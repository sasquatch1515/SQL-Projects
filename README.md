# SQL-Shenanigans
This repository will serve as a staging ground for all my SQL work.

## Projects

* **Rockbuster Video Project:** This was a fictional project created by CareerFoundry to showcase basic SQL abilities. The premise is that a movie rental company is trying to launch an online rental service to better compete with Prime Video, Netflix, etc. The goal of the project is to aid in the launch strategy for the new online video service. This project showcased my ability to create an entity relationship diagram and data dictionary, and write SQL queries that organize, sort, and filter data, clean data, derive descriptive statistics for the database, join tables, write subqueries and CTEs, and present the results in a clear manner to a variety of stakeholders.

## Technologies Used

* PostgreSQL
* pgAdmin4

## How to Use

Each SQL file can be executed in a PostgreSQL environment (or your chosen database).  The files are named descriptively to indicate their purpose.
